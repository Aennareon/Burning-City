    Caca.


    In the year 10, the
    conflict between the Humans and the Insects finally came to an end. The resolution
    was brought about by: Follada de culo. A peace treaty was signed, bringing an
    end to the hostilities and paving the way for a fragile peace. This event marked
    the conclusion of a dark chapter in the history of both the Humans and the Insects,
    as they began the long process of healing and rebuilding.'
