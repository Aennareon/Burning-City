### **Assets & Packages**  

1. **Free Use of Assets**: Any 3D models, artwork, Unity assets, or other media (hereafter referred to as "Assets") uploaded to this repository will be made available for **free use** under the intention of supporting non-commercial projects and collaborations.  
2. **Different License for Assets**: These Assets will be published with a **separate license** that governs their use. The terms of the Assets' license will be clearly specified within their respective folders or files, and may include restrictions such as:
   - Non-commercial use only.
   - No redistribution or reselling without prior permission.
   - Requirements for attribution.

### **Characters, Names & Stories**  

1. **Integration into the Project**: Any characters, names, stories, or other narrative elements created and integrated into the project (including but not limited to character designs, personal stories, or backgrounds) will be considered part of the project once added.  
2. **Ownership of Integrated Content**: Once a character, name, or story element is integrated into the game, it becomes part of the intellectual property of the project. Even if the character or story is inspired by the creator's personal ideas, it will no longer be treated as a standalone piece.  
3. **No Separate Tracking**: There will be no separate tracking of individual characters, names, or stories once integrated into the project. The integrated elements will be considered as part of the overall game and its narrative, without identifying individual contributions or ownership in the final product.  
4. **Contributors' Acknowledgment**: Although these elements become part of the game's intellectual property, contributors who create or provide such elements will still be acknowledged in the general contributor list, as mentioned in the **Attribution & Contributor Credit** section.

### **Content Moderation & Project Management**  

1. **Right to Manage & Decide Content**: As the owner of the project, I (the owner) reserve the right to act as the moderator and manager of the content contributed to the project. This means I can decide whether a specific contribution (such as assets, characters, or other project elements) should become part of the project or not.  
2. **Significance of Contributions**: I also reserve the right to decide whether a contribution is significant enough to warrant special recognition in the final product. This may include choosing which contributions merit explicit acknowledgment in the final release, and how that acknowledgment will be presented.  
3. **Commitment on Removed Content**: If a contribution is removed from the project and is no longer part of the final build, I commit to **not using or distributing that content for any commercial purposes**. Removed content will not be exploited commercially or redistributed for personal gain in any form.
