## 🤝 Contributing
This project is open to collaborations and online work. Also to the discussions, contributions and recommendations. But my goal is for this project to serve my personal portfolio or to obtain personal benefit, so I have decided to follow certain rules regarding coworking.

- Contributions to the project will be reviewed and cataloged
  - As a manager, I reserve the right to carry out this task or assign it to whoever I consider. I also reserve the right not to accept certain collaborations if they are not beneficial or significant.
  - A positive contribution will allow the creator to enter the list of collaborators. This list will keep a record of everyone who makes a contribution to the project and will always be accessible (At the moment it has not been created yet but it will be when there are contributions).
  - Contributions that reach the final version will receive special recognition. If a collaborator does not have contributions in the final version, he or she will remain on the list of collaborators that will always be included in the credits.
  - It is expected to receive a first and last name for mentions in the list of collaborators or final version, but if not provided, the collaborators will be mentioned by their username or name associated with the git account included in the contributions.

I want to give as much credit as possible to everyone who helps, so I hope you agree with these terms.
At the end of this document you will find my email, I am open to hearing any comments regarding collaboration in the project.
